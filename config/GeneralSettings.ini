[Camera Settings]
AOI_Position_X = 640 ; Is also the position of the set point for the full frame tracker,
AOI_Position_Y = 512 ; since there's probably no point centering the AOI anywhere else?
AOI_Size_X = 128 ;
AOI_Size_Y = 128 ;

Bits_Per_Pixel = 10 ; For DCC3240N camera, this is either 8 or 10. (10 only works with USB3!)

Pixel_Clock = 78 ; (int) Check specific camera for good value (and one which permits desired frame rate and exposure)
FrameRate_Full = 20 ; (double) FPS. of full frame image capture
FrameRate_AOI = 200 ; (double) AOI allows for higher frame rate
Exposure = 0.1 ;

[Spot Detection]
peak_Thresh_Full        = 0.5   ; 0.5 sensible (float) Don't count pixels lower than this proportion of the maximum when constructing the X and Y projections of the image.
gaussian_Thresh_Full	= 0.5 	; 0.5 sensible (float) Don't use any bins of the projection lower than this proportion of the maximum when fitting Gaussian
peak_Thresh_AOI		= 0.1       ; 0.1 good? Don't need to worry too much about background on AOI
gaussian_Thresh_AOI	= 0.05	    ; 0.05 good? For accuracy we want as much as possible
gaussian_SaveData	= false     ; (bool) Save x and y slice data when generating gaussians. - Probably don't use this unless debugging. It will super slow down the spot finding.
nPeakPixels		= 1500 	; (int) Number of pixels expected to be higher than 50% of maximum pixel brightness. (ie. area of FWHM of spot) (ish)

[Tracker Options]
Tracker_Period = 0 ; Turn tracker on/off with this period

do_AOI		= true ; AOI DRASTICALLY improves tracker bandwidth.
aoi_Threshold = 0.5 ;

pid_P		= 0.3 	;
pid_I		= 0.0	;
pid_D		= 0.0	;

pid_P_aoi 	= 0.0 	; PID parameters for when AOI is set.
pid_I_aoi 	= 0.0 	; Not clear if this is just because loop bandwidth changes
pid_D_aoi 	= 0.0	; but here's the option to have separate (if _all_ are 0, defaults to using non AOI versions)

Display_Mode = 3 	; (int) 0 = Don't draw circles. 1 = Draw spot circle. 2 = Also draw target circle, 3 = also draw AOI rectangle

[Mirror Settings]
Com_Port_Name = ttyACM0 ; (string) usually either (linux:) tty* or (windows:) COM*
